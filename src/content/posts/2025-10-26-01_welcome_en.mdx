After being "Under Construction" for several years, I've finally rebuilt my website: Masaki Haga (@silasolla).

Despite being a working web engineer, I've been the classic case of "the shoemaker's children go barefoot."

Most of my life has been spent casually tossing words onto social media just for others to read, but I hope to start collecting my daily notes here instead.
